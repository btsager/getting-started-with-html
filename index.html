<h1>Stage 0: Getting Started with HTML Notes</h1>

<b>WEB & HTML Basics</b>
<p>The baiscs of the WEB are broken into 5 categories; WEB, HTML, URLS, HTTP, and WEB Applications. WEB interaction involves computers,
HTTP requests, servers, HTML documents, and web browsers. The WWW is a collection of HTML documents, HTML stands for
<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>, it glues everything together and is the heart of the WEB.  Hyperlinks link the HTML documents together,
makign the WEB, web like. The Internet was invented in 1990, it has over 30 billion pages.

<b>HTML, TAGS, & ELEMENTS</b>
<p>HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see", <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks", reference
to other documents <em>images and videos</em>, and links to other pages.  HTML uses <b>tags</b> to tell browsers what type of HTML <b>element</b> to use.

opening tag, content, and closing tag.  Tags that have content require a closing tag, if the tag does not have content it is known as <b>void</b> and does
not require a closing tag.
</p>

<b>White Space, Inline, Block</b>
<p>The size of white space always equals one, no matter how large or long the white space appears in HTML.  Two Tags that help break out or group the 
HTML content are <b>line break</b> and <b>paragrah</b>.  In addiiton HTML Elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elements form an
"invisible box" around the content inside of them.  Break is <em>inline</em> and paragrah is <em>block</em>.

<b>Main Take Away Topics</b><br>

-What a Web Page is: A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and 
display them.<br>
-How Coding Works: Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions
the programmer wrote.<br>
-Computers are Stupid: Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax").<br>
-Programmers Can't Remember Everything: 
There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can always just look it
up. <br>
-Basic HTML Vocabulary: Tag, Element, & Attribute
